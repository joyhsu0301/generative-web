			<ul>
				<div id="green2"></div>
				<li>The video explained how CSS lets the client control the display </li>
				<li>Reminded me of how my prof used to describe CSS as a way to ensure your website "fails successfully"</li>
				<li>Paul Chan's article was a really good pick-me-up for me</li>
				<li>It kind of assured me that whatever we're all going through is part of the adventure</li>
				<li>I especially liked the way he explained the dual meaning behind "the origin is the goal"</li>
			</ul>
			for my assignment this week, I decided to center my styling around these 3 words: <a href="minimal.html">minimal</a>, <a href="maximal.html">maximal</a>, and glitchy (this is the homepage)

			<ul>
				<li>From the three styles I chose to make for this website, I didn't expect the positive responses I got for the glitchy one, but I'm glad I did</li>
				<li>It's a style I don't usually go for so I'm excited to play around with it more</li>
				<li>I remember using the Wayback Back when I was younger to see what the web looked like the year I was born</li>
				<li>It's interesting to see the design changes that have happened on the web throughout the years</li>
				<li>The fact that the web is not permanent but is rotting really stuck out to me because nowaways, especially with the rise of cancel culture, it really feels as if the internet is permanent</li>

			<ul>
				<li>A quote that stuck with me because I completely agree is "actual power keeps a low profile; actual power doesn't need a social media presence, it owns social media"</li>
				<li>It would make sense for acts of counterculture or counter hegemony to be staying anonymous or ephemerally present on the internet since everything on the internet is so hyperfocused on expression and permanence (or at least a preservation of it)</li>
				<li>Very small degrees of acts of counterculture that I can think of are perhaps Vtubers? They are still very present and expressive but their IRL identities are often hidden completely</li>
				<li>I wonder how one could be completely expressionless on the internet</li>
