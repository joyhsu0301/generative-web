				<li>The video explained how CSS lets the client control the display </li>
				<li>Reminded me of how my prof used to describe CSS as a way to ensure your website "fails successfully"</li>
				<li>Paul Chan's article was a really good pick-me-up for me</li>
				<li>It kind of assured me that whatever we're all going through is part of the adventure</li>
				<li>I especially liked the way he explained the dual meaning behind "the origin is the goal"</li>
			</ul>
			for my assignment this week, I decided to center my styling around these 3 words: <a href="minimal.html">minimal</a>, <a href="maximal.html">maximal</a>, and glitchy (this is the homepage)

				<li>From the three styles I chose to make for this website, I didn't expect the positive responses I got for the glitchy one, but I'm glad I did</li>
				<li>It's a style I don't usually go for so I'm excited to play around with it more</li>
				<li>I remember using the Wayback Back when I was younger to see what the web looked like the year I was born</li>
				<li>It's interesting to see the design changes that have happened on the web throughout the years</li>
				<li>The fact that the web is not permanent but is rotting really stuck out to me because nowaways, especially with the rise of cancel culture, it really feels as if the internet is permanent</li>

			<ul>
				<li>A quote that stuck with me because I completely agree is "actual power keeps a low profile; actual power doesn't need a social media presence, it owns social media"</li>
				<li>It would make sense for acts of counterculture or counter hegemony to be staying anonymous or ephemerally present on the internet since everything on the internet is so hyperfocused on expression and permanence (or at least a preservation of it)</li>
				<li>Very small degrees of acts of counterculture that I can think of are perhaps Vtubers? They are still very present and expressive but their IRL identities are often hidden completely</li>
				<li>I wonder how one could be completely expressionless on the internet because I don't think it's possible. The mere act of being on the internet (what websites you look at, prefer etc.) are an act of expression that reveals something about you</li>

				<li>For the js element of my website, I made the glitch bars change in width and length according to what day of the week and what week of the year it is so that the glitches look different every day</li>
				<li>I think it would be fun to add another more interactive element to the page (for example, when you hover over certain glitches, it creates more glitches etc...)</li>
				<li>I want to keep the glitch bars fixed and on top of the texts so that it really acts like a broken laptop screen</li>
				<li>After reading the reading, I'll definitely have to go and pay the NYPL a visit when I go back to New York. I can't believe I haven't gone yet</li>
				<li>I really enjoyed this week's reading, the author's tone was inviting, the topic was really interesting and there were images!</li>
				<li>Especially because of the pandemic we are becoming more attached to technology and social media. The only time I spend away from my phone and computer are when I go out and hang out with family or friends (thankfully I am in a country where I can do this).</li>
				<li>I can't remember where I read this, but boredom is actually good for the development of your brain and for boosting your creativity. So much of the technology I am consuming is solely used for curbing boredom, so I think that having a fixed "tech detox" is essential. I try to do this when I am on holiday, and I try to squeeze in at least 2 hours of sketching (on my sketchbook, not ipad) without any music/tech 2-3 times a week.</li>

				<li>Creating an Arena channel really helped me get inspiration for my project.</li>
				<li>Although I'm still not fully decided on how my website will work, I want to create a website that acts like a visitor's log. I like to flip through them when I find them in museums, shops and restaurants.</li>
				<li>I feel like those logs reveal so much and so little at the same time. It's generative as long as people contribute and "make their mark"</li>
				<li>Perhaps it might be helpful to have a general theme behind the concept of an online exchange diary though? Like having a prompt that they all have to answer, and from there the prompts change according to the last person's response?</li>
				<li>As for the aesthetics of the website, I want to keep it rather constraint since the content is so open. I'm currently really into monochromatic color schemes and those vintage grainy film texture filters. However, I think the aesthetics of the website is still very much up in the air.</li>

				<li>For this week, I continued to think about my project. I did a bit of research on what firebase is and how to implement it. I feel like I am able to grasp how to use it but I'm still a bit hesitant about how I should approach it, or if I should use it at all</li>
				<li>I am still drawn to the idea of having user input on my website, and then somehow distorting it so that when it is viewed again, the original message is different.</li>
				<li>The article talked a bit about netstalgia which I found to be really interesting. The author talked about how netstalgia isn't about the 90s internet aesthtic, but about the friction or user frustration it generated.</li>
				<li>I've always thought of netstalgia in terms of its aesthetics and not of how difficult it was to use; perhaps because I forget just how slow they were when I was a kid, browsing Youtube on my grandpa's old PC. But I do agree that what draws me into a brutalist website that uses very simple html code that does things like print the same text over and over is its ability to feel somehow intimate. It feels like an error that wasn't intentional, just something I chanced upon. </li>

				<li>For this week's initial sketches, I started by referring to rough wireframe sketches I had made previously.</li>
				<li>The feedback I got last week was really helpful in helping me ground my main concept, and really allowed me to expand on what themes or big ideas I wanted to focus on.</li>
				<li>While brainstorming, I focused on the idea of an anonymous collaboration between the people who visit my site to create a diary. A collection of texts, distorted with images to ensure anonymity, that anyone can look back on.</li>
				<li>It was easier for me to experiment with making what the website would look/feel like since I wanted to keep it quite minimal and straightforward. </li>

			<li>I continued to work on my sketch for what the front end of the website would look like.</li>
			<li>I've been having difficulties figuring out which js libraries to use, and mainly spent my time researching how to store the user input elements into firebase.</li>
			<li>The reading this week was really interesting in establishing how setting restrictions and limiting interactions can result in many different variations of possible end results. Using games as an anology, it applies well to my project. It makes me think about the rules and restrictions I'm setting on the users who visit my website, and how those restrictions could be used to create something interesting and different, while maintaing the user's identities hidden.</li>

			<li>This week, I worked on implementing firebase into my project. I experimented with it on a completely new index.html file so I will need to figure out how to implement it into my exisitng html/css/js documents.</li>
			<li>I enabled users to sign in with their google accounts but I have yet to implement the code that will save user inputs to the firebase database. I plan to do this once I add firebase to my existing documents which sketched out the look and feel of the website</li>
			<li>I'm slowly getting the hang of how firebase works and its functionalities so I'm quite happy with the progress I made this week.</li>
			<li>This week's reading "Data Sweat" reminded me how our activities online are constantly being tracked and accumulated. Although we don't necessarily realize it, it's crazy how intimate our metadata is to our behavior in real life.</li>
			<li>Reading this really made me think about my own digital footprint, and how the internet is so irreversibly intertwined with my identity. It makes me wonder how our relationship with the internet is going to progress from this point onwards in terms of our codependency on each other.</li>

		<ul>
			<li>This week's reading about democratizing the internet talked about how easily people can obtain and sell your information. Database leaks are more common than most people would like but it's something we can't escape from if we use the internet at any capacity.</li>
			<li>My experience with the peer-to-peer model is limited. In high school I use to torrent TV shows and movies and in return I would also seed. The only thing is that for some of the older movies I wanted, not enough people would seed them so it would either never load or I just couldn't download it. I think that a peer-to-peer internet is possible but like the author said, very very difficult because of the large corporations running the internet behind the scenes.</li>
			<li>I worked on making a new sketch that merged the two sketches from last week so that it has both firebase functionalities and a designed front end. On the previous front-end only sketch, I also created a quick mockup of what a working "view other's responses" page could look like as reference for the new sketch.</li>
			<li>On the merged sketch, I tested out the storing input functionality from firebase. It's still a work in progress at the moment but the website is coming along.</li>
			<li>For next week, I'm planning on writing and implementing the js code that will censor out any inapporpriate words if the user were to input any. I'm also thinking about testing out different fonts for the landing page and perhaps making it look smore friendly.</li>

			<li>Based on the feedback I got from last week, I decided to focus more on the design of the responses page this week as opposed to getting too pigeonholed in trying to figure out the firebase functions</li>
			<li>I also slightly changed up some of the fonts and design on the homepage, as well as adding a popup window explaining what this website is about</li>
			<li>I also decided on the prompt and overall theme I want this website to have. I changed the prompt to "what advice do you wish you could give to your younger self?" as I feel like this is a question that would yield answers that change with to time.</li>
			<li>This led me to the idea of a time capsule, and how I can echo this through the design and layout of the responses page.</li>

		<ul>
			<li>For this week, I made small tweaks so that the website would be responsive when viewed on the phone. I mainly changed font sizes since the majority of the elements on my website have been positioned using flexbox.</li>
			<li>I expanded further on the idea of a time capsule and added pngs of slips of paper that the responses would be appended on top of. I wanted to use pictures of paper to add an element from real life to remind visitors that these responses are written by real people who have also visited the same site and answered the same prompt.</li>
			<li>I'm still having a bit of trouble appending the responses onto the response page but I'm not far off.</li>

			<li>Against Software Development points out how we seek efficiency, but eventually it will expand to a point where we are unable to comprehend it. To me, this was an interesting thought that I had never considered but 100% agree with. An example I thought of was the Y2K scare. Perhaps there's a crisis similar to that coming our way?</li>
			<li>I liked that the overall sentiment of this article, and all of the articles we've been reading this semester, was to encourage us to look outside of giant tech corporations and work on things that matter. Even if it's only for yourself, there's more to be done on the internet than to be completely consumed by giant tech companies that is already quietly ruling our society and lives.</li>
			<li>For the final touches of this website, I added favicons and meta tags after I figured out how to append the responses. I set the favicon as the same png of the slip of paper I used for the responses but I added a small icon of a sphere to represent the web.</li>
