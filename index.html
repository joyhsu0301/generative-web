				<li>The video explained how CSS lets the client control the display </li>
				<li>Reminded me of how my prof used to describe CSS as a way to ensure your website "fails successfully"</li>
				<li>Paul Chan's article was a really good pick-me-up for me</li>
				<li>It kind of assured me that whatever we're all going through is part of the adventure</li>
				<li>I especially liked the way he explained the dual meaning behind "the origin is the goal"</li>
			</ul>
			for my assignment this week, I decided to center my styling around these 3 words: <a href="minimal.html">minimal</a>, <a href="maximal.html">maximal</a>, and glitchy (this is the homepage)

				<li>From the three styles I chose to make for this website, I didn't expect the positive responses I got for the glitchy one, but I'm glad I did</li>
				<li>It's a style I don't usually go for so I'm excited to play around with it more</li>
				<li>I remember using the Wayback Back when I was younger to see what the web looked like the year I was born</li>
				<li>It's interesting to see the design changes that have happened on the web throughout the years</li>
				<li>The fact that the web is not permanent but is rotting really stuck out to me because nowaways, especially with the rise of cancel culture, it really feels as if the internet is permanent</li>

			<ul>
				<li>A quote that stuck with me because I completely agree is "actual power keeps a low profile; actual power doesn't need a social media presence, it owns social media"</li>
				<li>It would make sense for acts of counterculture or counter hegemony to be staying anonymous or ephemerally present on the internet since everything on the internet is so hyperfocused on expression and permanence (or at least a preservation of it)</li>
				<li>Very small degrees of acts of counterculture that I can think of are perhaps Vtubers? They are still very present and expressive but their IRL identities are often hidden completely</li>
				<li>I wonder how one could be completely expressionless on the internet because I don't think it's possible. The mere act of being on the internet (what websites you look at, prefer etc.) are an act of expression that reveals something about you</li>

				<li>For the js element of my website, I made the glitch bars change in width and length according to what day of the week and what week of the year it is so that the glitches look different every day</li>
				<li>I think it would be fun to add another more interactive element to the page (for example, when you hover over certain glitches, it creates more glitches etc...)</li>
				<li>I want to keep the glitch bars fixed and on top of the texts so that it really acts like a broken laptop screen</li>
				<li>After reading the reading, I'll definitely have to go and pay the NYPL a visit when I go back to New York. I can't believe I haven't gone yet</li>
				<li>I really enjoyed this week's reading, the author's tone was inviting, the topic was really interesting and there were images!</li>
				<li>Especially because of the pandemic we are becoming more attached to technology and social media. The only time I spend away from my phone and computer are when I go out and hang out with family or friends (thankfully I am in a country where I can do this).</li>
				<li>I can't remember where I read this, but boredom is actually good for the development of your brain and for boosting your creativity. So much of the technology I am consuming is solely used for curbing boredom, so I think that having a fixed "tech detox" is essential. I try to do this when I am on holiday, and I try to squeeze in at least 2 hours of sketching (on my sketchbook, not ipad) without any music/tech 2-3 times a week.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>Creating an Arena channel really helped me get inspiration for my project.</li>
				<li>Although I'm still not fully decided on how my website will work, I want to create a website that acts like a visitor's log. I like to flip through them when I find them in museums, shops and restaurants.</li>
				<li>I feel like those logs reveal so much and so little at the same time. It's generative as long as people contribute and "make their mark"</li>
				<li>Perhaps it might be helpful to have a general theme behind the concept of an online exchange diary though? Like having a prompt that they all have to answer, and from there the prompts change according to the last person's response?</li>
				<li>As for the aesthetics of the website, I want to keep it rather constraint since the content is so open. I'm currently really into monochromatic color schemes and those vintage grainy film texture filters. However, I think the aesthetics of the website is still very much up in the air.</li>
