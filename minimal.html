				Video + article response: 
			<ul>
				<li>The video explained how CSS lets the client control the display </li>
				<li>Reminded me of how my prof used to describe CSS as a way to ensure your website "fails successfully"</li>
				<li>Paul Chan's article was a really good pick-me-up for me</li>
				<li>It kind of assured me that whatever we're all going through is part of the adventure</li>
				<li>I especially liked the way he explained the dual meaning behind "the origin is the goal"</li>
			</ul>
				for my assignment this week, I decided to center my styling around these 3 words: <a href="minimal.html">MINIMAL</a>, <a href="maximal.html">MAXIMAL</a>, and <a href="index.html">GLITCHY</a>
